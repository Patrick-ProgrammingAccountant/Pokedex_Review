# Pokedex_Review
Pandas exercise with the Pokedex data

The point of this is to practice my Pandas knowledge using the Pokedex information as a resource.
- Specifically I want to provide code that will gather the top ten pokemon of a desired type and provide stats concerning that type

The data used was from Keith Galli's github, please check him out at:

You can also check out the corresponding videa at:

The coding was based off of Keith's but modified to fit my needs.
